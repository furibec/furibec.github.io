<hr>
I am a Data Scientist at [Danfoss Leanheat](https://leanheat.com/). I also have a part-time position as a Postdoctoral Researcher within the School of Engineering Sciences at Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT), where I am working with [Lassi Roininen](https://www.lut.fi/fi/profiilit/lassi-roininen).

My research interests lie at the interface of computational science and applied probability and statistics. In particular: uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo methods, rare event simulation, and data assimilation.

This homepage contains information about my research in [scientific journals](/publications/) and [meetings](/talks/). I summarized my [personal background](/cv/), and I am planning to include more of my Python code packages as well.
