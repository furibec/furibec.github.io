<hr>
I am a Data Scientist at [Danfoss Leanheat](https://leanheat.com/) working in the Data Science team lead by [Antti Solonen](https://github.com/solbes). 

I hold a doctoral degree from the Technical University of Munich (Germany), including research experience at MIT (USA). Additionally, I have completed postdoctoral work at the Technical University of Denmark (Denmark) and LUT University (Finland).

My research interests lie at the interface of computational sciences and applied probability and statistics. In particular: uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo methods, rare event simulation, and data assimilation.

This homepage contains information about my research in [scientific journals](/publications/) and [meetings](/talks/). I summarized my [personal background](/cv/), and I am planning to include more information about my Python code as well.
