## Lectures

The courses at LUT and DTU were based on the following slides (with different topic variations), with derivations and examples done on blackboard. At some point, I should create a GitHub repository with all the Python codes we covered in class.

1. [[00 - Introduction]](../files/00_main_slides_intro.pdf)
2. [[01 - Intro probability theory]](../files/01_main_slides_prob.pdf)
3. [[02a - Monte Carlo methods]](../files/02_main_slides_MC.pdf)
4. [[02b - Variance reduction methods]](../files/03_main_slides_vared.pdf)
5. [[03 - Random fields, KL expansion and neural networks]](../files/04_main_slides_RFs_BNNs.pdf)
6. [[04 - Bayesian inverse problems]](../files/05_main_slides_inference.pdf)
7. [[05a - Prior models and intro model selection]](../files/06_main_slides_priors.pdf)
8. [[05b - MCMC and approximation methods]](../files/07_main_slides_MCMC.pdf)
