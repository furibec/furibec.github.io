I am a Data Scientist within the Data Analysis division of Danfoss Leanheat in Helsinki, Finland.

### Experience and Education
Before moving to industry, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Engineering Sciences at LUT University (Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology) from October 2022 until July 2024. I worked with [Lassi Roininen](https://www.lut.fi/fi/profiilit/lassi-roininen).

Before moving to Finland, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/) from March 2020 until August 2022. I worked with [Per Christian Hansen](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/) and [Yiqiu Dong](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~yido/index.html) in the [CUQI](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/cuqi) project (**C**omputational **U**ncertainty **Q**uantification for **I**nverse problems), sponsored by the [Villum Foundation](https://villumfonden.dk/en).

Before moving to Denmark, I earned a doctoral degree (*Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften*, Dr.-Ing.) from the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de), where I was a student of [Daniel Straub](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/era/team/daniel-straub/) and [Iason Papaioannou](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/era/team/iason-papaioannou/) from May 2016 until February 2020. During my doctoral studies, I was part of the project [10.02/BAYES](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/en/igsse/doctorate-at-igsse/) (10th cohort) within the International Graduate School of Science and Engineering ([IGSSE](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/index.php?id=5)). Moreover, I collaborated with the Uncertainty Quantification group of [Youssef M. Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/people) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I spent the fall semester of 2018.

Before moving to Germany, I did my bachelor in Civil Engineering and Master in Engineering at the [National University of Colombia at Manizales](https://www.manizales.unal.edu.co/) under the supervision of [Diego A. Alvarez](https://sites.google.com/site/diegoandresalvarezmarin/). My bachelor thesis was selected as the [best bachelor final project](https://pregrado.unal.edu.co/mejorestrabajos) in Civil Engineering that year. During my Master studies, I was (twice) a "Young Researcher" sponsored by the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation ([Colciencias](https://minciencias.gov.co/)) and the National University of Colombia.

### Digital Book 
My colleagues back at DTU are developing an online mini-book on [*Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems with CUQIpy*](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQI-Book/intro.html). I will be contributing with different topics, such as Monte Carlo methods, MCMC, Bayesian inverse problems, priors, etc.

### Code
Oftentimes I release the codes associated with my research. 

- **Python**: simulation methods for rare event simulation ([GitHub](https://github.com/furibec/rare_event_simulation)) - code maintenance level: *medium*.
- **Python**: computational uncertainty quantification for inverse problems (CUQIpy) ([GitHub](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy)) - Contributor.
- **MATLAB**: random fields, polynomial chaos, and spectral stochastic finite elements ([FileExchange](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2912338)) - code maintenance level: *low*.

### Freetime activities
Outside of my work, I am passionate about arts and nature. I like checking out 
museums, and hiking through forests and mountains. Moreover, I enjoy playing 
chess, making [Scandinavian flat-plane 
carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_flat-
plane_style_of_woodcarving), and gardening. I have been practicing the art of 
Bonsai since 2010; more seriously since discovering [Bonsai 
Mirai](https://live.bonsaimirai.com/) (and since visiting Japan in 2023!).
