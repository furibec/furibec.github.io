I am a Data Scientist within the data science division of Leanheat by Danfoss. Concurrently, I also hold a part-time Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Engineering Sciences at the LUT University in Finland.


### Experience and Education
I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/) from March 2020 until August 2022. I worked with [Per Christian Hansen](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~pcha/) and [Yiqiu Dong](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~yido/index.html) in the [CUQI](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/cuqi) project (**C**omputational **U**ncertainty **Q**uantification for **I**nverse problems), sponsored by the [Villum Foundation](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en).

Before moving to Copenhagen, I earned a doctoral degree (*Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften*, Dr.-Ing.) from the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de), where I was a student of [Daniel Straub](https://www.bgu.tum.de/era/team/daniel-straub/) from May 2016 until February 2020. During my doctoral studies, I was part of the project [10.02/BAYES](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/en/igsse/projects-and-teams/igsse-call-projects/) within the International Graduate School of Science and Engineering ([IGSSE](https://www.igsse.gs.tum.de/index.php?id=5)). Moreover, I collaborated with the group of [Youssef M. Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/people) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I spent the fall semester of 2018.

Before moving to Munich, I did my bachelor in Civil Engineering and Master in Engineering at the [National University of Colombia at Manizales](https://unal.edu.co/en.html) under the supervision of [Diego A. Alvarez](https://diegoandresalvarez.github.io/). My bachelor thesis was selected as the [best bachelor final project](http://www.pregrado.unal.edu.co/mejores-trabajos-de-grado/) in Civil Engineering that year. During my Master studies, I was (twice) a "Young Researcher" sponsored by the Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation ([Colciencias](https://minciencias.gov.co/)) and the National University of Colombia.

### Code
Oftentimes, I try to release the codes related to my research. I am also involved in the development of the CUQIpy package (computational uncertainty quantification for inverse problems in Python):
- **Python**: CUQIpy - [github](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy) (code maintenance level: *high*). Simulation methods for rare event simulation - [github](https://github.com/furibec/rare_event_simulation) (code maintenance level: *medium*).
- **MATLAB**: random fields, polynomial chaos, and spectral stochastic finite elements - [matlabcentral](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2912338) (code maintenance level: *low*).

### Freetime activities
Outside of my work, I am passionate about nature and arts, and I like hiking in forests and mountains. I also enjoy chess (we can play in [lichess](https://lichess.org/)!, look for **DrVilppu**), [Scandinavian flat-plane carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_flat-plane_style_of_woodcarving), gardening, and anime. I have been practicing the art of Bonsai since 2010; more seriously since discovering [Bonsai Mirai](https://live.bonsaimirai.com/) (and since visiting Japan in 2023!).
